# Team Project

## Description
A desktop application created using web technologies based on the project brief provided about managing air ticket sales.  

Technology used:
- React
- Electron
- Bootstrap
- NodeJs
- Express
- MongoDB
- check dependancy list for more.

## Instructions

-   Please run command before trying to run project:
    -   `yarn install` installs the dependancies for frontend
    -   `cd server` move into server directory
    -   `yarn install` installs the dependancies for the backend
-   to run project
    -   `yarn dev`
        -   Run Electron application and server
    -   or
        -   `yarn electron-dev` or `yarn start` start as desktop app or website
        -   `cd server` move into server directory
        -   `yarn start` run server

*   The list of dependancies can be found in the respective package.json files under dependancies.
*   In the submission we shall include the dependancies. However it is best to run `yarn install` to install them.

## Disclaimer

Please install before running:

-   NodeJS (npm)
-   Yarn
-   MongoDB

### Macs:

If you do not have Homebrew, install by:
`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`

then you can:
`brew install node`
`brew install yarn`

Follow `https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/` for instructions on installing a local mongoDB and run it

-   To populate DB, can restore from backups via system or just use the system.

### Windows:

`https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm`
`https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable`
`https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

-   Run Electron application and server

### `yarn electron-dev`

-   Run as an Electron Application when developing

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

<!-- ### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
